# Tiffin Columbian Obituaries

This is a website for **Tiffin Columbian** alumni to post obituaries for their respective classes by year.

- If you are interested in *refining* this process or creating a *duplicate* structure for your class,
please contact me.  The material within is built using `MarkDown` on `GitHub` pages, so it is a relatively
simple process to construct, especially if you know what those terms mean.

- If you are an alumni of TC 1981 and notice an error in the material that I have gathered so far,
please contact me.
